This project provides an inexpensive means of remotely performing a STOP (ALT+S) to Mach3. This is accomplished with a Raspberry Pi (RPi) + Camera connected to a PC via a USB cable. Monitoring and activating the STOP on the CNC is done with a video streaming web application running on the RPi. Using this solution should be done at your own risk. I highly recommend contacting the manufacturer of your CNC, and purchase and install the recommended remote emergency stop specified.

**Note:** This is not the same as an Emergency Stop (EStop) wired into your CNC control panel, but the execution of a hotkey to perform a STOP of Mach3.

## Parts
![Parts](https://github.com/sbkirby/RPi_remote_cnc_STOP/blob/master/images/parts.jpg)

* Raspberry Pi Zero W
* Raspberry Pi Zero 1.3 Camera Cable
* Raspberry Pi Camera (Note: USB Webcams are not supported)
* Case for Raspberry Pi and Camera
* micro SD card 16 GB
* USB cable

## Assemble Camera and Installing Raspbian
Assemble RPi Camera, cable and RPi together per instructions found at How to connect Raspberry Pi camera module to Raspberry Pi Zero W and the official case. Note: USB Webcams are not supported.

Install the latest version of Raspbian on the Raspberry Pi Zero W. I recommend following the step-by-step instructions can be found at Adafruit's Raspberry Pi Zero Headless Quick Start.

Perform an SSH connection to the RPi, as mentioned in the instructions above, and initiate a general system configuration by running the raspi-config utility.
```
sudo raspi-config
```
## Enable Camera

In the raspi-config main window select number *5. Interfacing Options - Configure connections to peripherals*. In the next window, select P1. Camera - Enable/Disable connection to the Raspberry Pi Camera. The next window will ask Would you like the camera interface to be enabled? Select and hit Enter. The last screen will indicate that the camera interface has been enabled, and press Enter for . This will return you to the main window of raspi-config.

## Expand Filesystem

In the raspi-config main window select number **7. Advanced Options - Configure advanced settings**. In the next window, select A1. Expand Filesystem - Ensures that all of the SD card storage is used. After selecting this item a window will appear indicating Root partition has been resized. The filesystem will be enlarged upon the next reboot. Hit the Enter key to select . This will return you the raspi-config main window.

## Boot Options

In the raspi-config main window select number **3. Boot Options - Configure options for start-up**. In the next screen, select B1. Desktop / CLI - Choose whether to boot into a desktop enviroment. This will take you to the final window, and select B1. Console - Text console, requiring user to login. Selecting this will take you back to the raspi-config main window.

You can exit raspi-config by selecting , which will probably require a reboot. Execute the reboot, and SSH back into the RPi.

## Configure the RPi Into USB Keyboard (HID)
![HID0 Before](https://github.com/sbkirby/RPi_remote_cnc_STOP/blob/master/images/list_device_hid0_before.jpg)

A STOP is generated by sending an ALT+s keystroke via the RPi to the PC running Mach3. As a result, the RPi needs to configured to appear and operate as USB Keyboard to the PC. This allows it to send hotkeys commands such as ALT+s to the PC. Instructions for configuring the RPi are found at Turn Raspberry Pi Zero into USB Keyboard (HID).

After a reboot, enter the following command:
```
ls -l /dev/hid*
```
You should see the device /dev/hidg0 appearing in the list as seen above. The group access and the read and write access to this device will be altered in steps to follow.

## Install RPi-Cam-Web-Interface

Install streaming video and web server software per instructions at [RPi-Cam-Web-Interface](https://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface).

During the installation you will be asked the following Configuration Options:

* Cam subfolder: html
* Autostart: (yes/no) yes
* Server: (apache/nginx/lighttpd) apache
* Webport: 80
* User: (blank=nologin) admin (example)
* Password: #34By97Zz (example)
* jpglink: (yes/no) no
* phpversion: (5/7) 7

I chose the default inputs to simplify the installation, but added a User and Password to secure the RPi Web Page. Select and continue with the installation. At the end you be asked to Start Camera System Now select and continue. If successful, you will be taken to the command prompt.

## Grant www-data Access to Device /dev/hidg0
![HID0 After](https://github.com/sbkirby/RPi_remote_cnc_STOP/blob/master/images/list_device_hid0_after.jpg)

Now that all of the applications and hardware have been installed the last tweaks can be done to finalize the installation. The objective in this step is to grant user www-data access to the USB Keyboard device /dev/hidg0.

First, create a group called hid and add www-data to the group:
```
sudo addgroup hid
sudo adduser www-data hid
```
Next, open /etc/rc.local with this command (again):
```
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```
Add the following before the line containing exit 0, but below the line you added in the Configure the RPi Into USB Keyboard (HID) Step :
```
sudo chown root:hid /dev/hidg0
sudo chmod 660 /dev/hidg0
```
The above command will provide the necessary access to device /dev/hidg0 for user www-data. After the above modifications have been made and a reboot you see the /dev/hidg0 device with following command:
```
ls -l /dev/hid*
```
Notice the group for this device is now hid and the group has read and write access.

======================================

Optional: If you wish to use scripts that access GPIO, I2C and/or SPI via the RPi Web page, you will need to enable these interfaces in raspi-config. Secondly, you will need to grant user www-data access to these interfaces.
```
sudo usermod -a -G gpio,i2c,spi www-data
```

## Configure the Web Interface
